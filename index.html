                <p id="fact-1">Eriogonum grande var. rubescens: “Red Buckwheat” or “Rosy Buckwheat” is reminiscent of “Rosy the Riveter”  - which is to say, it’s tough, and very useful, as well as pretty. </p>
                <p id="fact-2">Rosy is on the small side for a buckwheat; about 1 to 2 ft. tall and wide with a mounding habit.</p>
                <p id="fact-3">Red buckwheat needs very little water after its initial settling in period and grows well in full sun by the coast and with a little shade inland.</p>

                <p id="fact-3">“California Buckwheat” needs very little care, is drought tolerant and goes on blooming, from late spring through summer into the fall. At PHIG it is located in the dry garden with no additional summer watering.</p>
                <p id="fact-1">Of the varieties, Eriogonum fasciculatum foliolosum  tends to be a bit taller, with darker leaves.</p>
                <p id="fact-2">The profusion of 3 clusters are cream to white in color; the blooms eventually fade into a rusty shade in the fall. California buckwheat can grow up to 3' to 4’ tall and as wide. </p>
